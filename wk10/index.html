    <br>2 ways to make lists. with a constructor, or with []. you can prepopulate a list
    <br>ex01 = list() -- list creator
    <br>ex02 = []
    <br>primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13]
    <br>primes.append(17) -> will add 17 to the end of the list
    <br>in 'lists' the order of data is important, in 'sets' the data order is not important.
    <br>In Lists Order is Everything
    <br> you can access a value in a list by it's index. ex: primes[2] will return '5'
    <br> if you enter a -1 as an index python will start counting from the end of the list (17) in our example
    <br> <b>Slicing</b> type the list name, starting index and closing index. ex:
    <br><i>primes[2:5]</i> returns [5,7,11] the result is a sublist of numbers beginning at index 2 up to 5 (does not include that index)
    <br> lists can contain other lists
    <br> you can combine lists together by simply concatenating them using the '+' ex:
    <br> primes + letters = [2,3,5,7,11,13, 'a', 'b', 'c']

    <br> print to an end element. ex: nums[2:] -- will print the item at index 2 (3rd item) to the end of the list
    <br> with list we can combine them into one ex:
    <br>mil = [nums, names] -> if there were a nums list and a names list they would now be joined in the nums + names order and stored as variable mil
    <br> in Python lists are 'mutable' meaning that we can change their value. '.append()'
    <br> Append and Insert are similar, but different methods. Remove and Pop are also similar, but different
    <br>.push and .pop are for working with the stack
    <br> you can add multiple items to a list with .extend([2,22,34,76]). must have parens and square brackets to extend
    <br> you can interact with lists in python, ex: min(nums) - will return the smallest int in the list, max(nums) will return the largest number
    <br> sum(nums) will give you the sum of the numbers in the list

    <br><br> Socratica Python Tuples Intro
    <br> lists use []; while Tuples use ()
    <br> ex: <i>tuples.py</i>
    <br> lists have many more methods available than tuples.

    <br> to view the methods available for an object use 'dir' on the object ex: <i>print(dir(prime_num))</i> in the list / tuples example
    <br> lists occupy more memory in a program than tuples, but have more functionality
    <br><br> Lists can be changed, Tuples are immutable

    <h3>Lists</h3>

    <br>both lists and tuples are kinds of sequences in programming; sequences are objects that contain multiple items of data
    <br>Lists are mutable (can be changed, add, change, or delete elements); Tuples are immutable (unchangeable)
    <br>going to examples:
    <br>lists can be concatenated, lists can be multiplied by themselves to double, or triple themselves
    <br>reference end of list with -1, -2, -3
    <br> list splicing [4:6]
    <br> change value at index, ex: L[2] = 18 (will change the value at index 2)
    <br> can Concatenate lists, ex: L1 + L2
    <br> check to see if an item is on the list ex: 50 in L -> returns False because 50 is not on the list
    <br> ex: 49 in L -> will return True because the value 49 is contained in the list
    <br><b>L.append() </b> -- add an item to the end of the list
    <br><b>L.index(5)</b> -- returns the value in that index spot
    <br><b>L.remove()</b>
    <br><b>L.sort()</b> to sort all values need to be the same
    <br><b>del L[-1]</b> will delete the last value of the list
    <br><br> to Copy lists you must, ex:
    <br><b> list = [] + L</b> -- setting variable list equal to an empty list + the existing list "L"
    <br> there is also a .copy() method in list

    <br><br> <b>Two-Dimensional List </b> - a list that contains lists as it's elements; aka <b>Nested List</b>
    <br>common to think of 2D lists as having rows and columns; useful for working with multiple data sets
    <br> to process the data, you must use 2 indexes
    <br><br> <b>you can Abate a global variable with .append()</b>

    <br><br> tuples have parens (tuple, tuple) instead of square brackets [list, list]
    <br> tuples and lists both have: subscript indexing; methods such as index; built in functions: len, min, max; slicing expressions; the in, +, and * operators
    <br> tuples are immutable, therefore cannot be modified: cannot: append; remove, insert, reverse, or sort
    <br>faster to create than lists, take up less space in memory (smaller size)
    <br><br> you can convert a tuple to a list with the <b>list()</b> function
    <br><b>tuple()</b> function converts a list to a tuple
