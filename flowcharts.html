    <h1>some Flowchart and Pseudocode notes</h1>
    the rounded rectangles are the 'start' and 'end'
    <br>parallelogram is either an 'input' or 'output' statement
    <br>rhombus is a conditional statement and can show up inside loops or many other places
    <br>the rectangle - the verb- an operation occurs, a variable is set, a calculation is made, etc... but an operation happens: normally using an assignment operator
    <h2>another set of notes</h2>
    schematic that uses special images to represent an algorithm or process.
    <br><br> rounded rectangle - start; not all flow charts will have an end
    <br> rectangle - the action verb, ex: add 1, turn on motor, turn off light, rotate part...
    <br> parallelogram - input / output - indicates a manual operation is needed, ex: type in weight, check the balance, time the operation...
    <br> rhombus / aka diamond - Decision, has an outcome of 'Yes' or 'No'; ex: is > 10; does the weight meet specifications, has the count been reached?
    <br> arrows - the arrows indicate the flow of the chart. only 1 arrow can represent 'outputs'; multiple arrows may represent inputs
    <h4>logic of flowchart</h4>
    what do we want the outcome to be? and how will we start? always start with 'start'
