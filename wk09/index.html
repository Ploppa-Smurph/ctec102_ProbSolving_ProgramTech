    <br><br>File Input and Output, Using Loops to Process Files, Processing Records, Exceptions
    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
    read from a file, write from a file. Data is stored as variables and saved to a file for use later.
    <br>Files are saved from RAM and stored onto physical storage.
    <br>3 steps when a program uses a file. it Open the file, Process the file, and Closes the file
    <h3>Types of Files and File Access Methods</h3>
    <b>Text Files</b> - contains data has been encoded as text. uses .txt file
    <br><b>Binary Files</b> - contains data that has not been converted to text.
    <br><br>Two ways to access data stored in a file
    <br><b>Sequential Access</b> - files are read sequentially from beginning to end, NO skipping ahead
    <br><b>Direct Access</b> - can jump directly to any piece of data in the file

    <h3>File Names and File Objects</h3>
    we will be using .txt (text) files.
    <br>File Object -- object associated with a specific file the object is referenced by a variable
    <h3>Open Function - open()</h3>
    creates a file object and associates it with a file on the disk
    <br>ex: <b>file_object = open(filename, mode)</b>
    <br><br><b>Mode</b> - the mode is a string which specifies how to open the file, 'r' = read; 'w' = write; and 'a' = append
    <br> you have to specify a path, otherwise the program will automatically create a file with that name in the current directory
    <br><br> <b>Methods</b> are functions which belong to objects
    <br><br><b>write</b> method which is used to write data to the file ex: <b>file_variable.write(string)</b>
    <br><br><b>close</b> method is used to close the file object after manipulating the file. ex: <b>file_variable.close()</b>
    <h3>Reading Data from a File</h3>
    <b>read</b> method - file must be opened first, this method will read the entire file in RAM and return the contents as a String
    <br><br><b>readline</b> method - a method to read a line from the file. Lines are returned as a string, including '\n'
    <br><b>Read Position</b> - marks the location of the next item to be read from a file
    <br><br> example: <i>read_print.py</i>
    <h3>Append a line to a file</h3>

    <h3>Append File</h3>
    ex: <i>append_file.py</i>

    <br><br><b>Delete a file</b> -- import os library in python and use the os.remove('blah.txt') method

    <h3>Writing to a File</h3>

    <br><br> ex: <i>write_file.py</i> and <i>read_sum.py</i>
