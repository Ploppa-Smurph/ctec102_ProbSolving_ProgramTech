    <br><br>File Input and Output, Using Loops to Process Files, Processing Records, Exceptions
    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
    read from a file, write from a file. Data is stored as variables and saved to a file for use later.
    <br>Files are saved from RAM and stored onto physical storage.
    <br>3 steps when a program uses a file. it Open the file, Process the file, and Closes the file
    <h3>Types of Files and File Access Methods</h3>
    <b>Text Files</b> - contains data has been encoded as text. uses .txt file
    <br><b>Binary Files</b> - contains data that has not been converted to text.
    <br><br>Two ways to access data stored in a file
    <br><b>Sequential Access</b> - files are read sequentially from beginning to end, NO skipping ahead
    <br><b>Direct Access</b> - can jump directly to any piece of data in the file

    <h3>File Names and File Objects</h3>
    we will be using .txt (text) files.
    <br>File Object -- object associated with a specific file the object is referenced by a variable
    <h3>Open Function - open()</h3>
    creates a file object and associates it with a file on the disk
    <br>ex: <b>file_object = open(filename, mode)</b>
    <br><br><b>Mode</b> - the mode is a string which specifies how to open the file, 'r' = read; 'w' = write; and 'a' = append
    <br> you have to specify a path, otherwise the program will automatically create a file with that name in the current directory
    <br><br> <b>Methods</b> are functions which belong to objects
    <br><br><b>write</b> method which is used to write data to the file ex: <b>file_variable.write(string)</b>
    <br><br><b>close</b> method is used to close the file object after manipulating the file. ex: <b>file_variable.close()</b>
    <h3>Reading Data from a File</h3>
    <b>read</b> method - file must be opened first, this method will read the entire file in RAM and return the contents as a String
    <br><br><b>readline</b> method - a method to read a line from the file. Lines are returned as a string, including '\n'
    <br><b>Read Position</b> - marks the location of the next item to be read from a file
    <br><br> example: <i>read_print.py</i>
    <h3>Append a line to a file</h3>

    <h3>Append File</h3>
    ex: <i>append_file.py</i>

    <br><br><b>Delete a file</b> -- import os library in python and use the os.remove('blah.txt') method

    <h3>Writing to a File</h3>

    <br><br> ex: <i>write_file.py</i> and <i>read_sum.py</i>

    <br><br>ex: <i>write_rand.py</i>
    <br> this project iterates a loop 100 times and writes 100 random number between 1 and 100 and then create a file with the results named 'random.txt'
    <br>ex: <i>read_numbers_1.py</i>
    <h2>File Display: Pearson Video</h2>
    <a href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/_video.true/File_Display">link to File Display video</a>
    <br><br> Assume a file containing integers in named numbers.txt and exists on the computer's disk. write a program that displays all of the numbers in the file.
    <br><br> Psuedocode:
    <pre>
Open file
For each line in the file:
    read and display the line
Close the file
</pre>

    <br> Basics of File Input and Output; Using Loops to process files; Handling ExceptionsS
    <br><br>we will work with 'persistent' data that exists beyond the program running in RAM
    <br>text or binary files
    <br> 2 basic ways to access files: Sequential and Random access
    <br><br> create a variable to hold the <b>'File Object'</b> - use this every time you do a file operation
    <ul> mode specifier
        <li>'r' - read</li>
        <li>'w' - write</li>
        <li>'a' - append</li>
    </ul>
    ex: using path: <b>hobbyFile = open(r'c:\Files\myhobbies.txt', 'r')</b> -- must use "r" before the full path telling Python this is a 'raw' string
    <br><br><b>write</b> to a file:
    <br><br> ex: <b>patientFile.write('John Doe\n')</b> # one string per line
    <br> <b>patientFile.write(str(43) + '\n')</b> # age -> string
    <br><br>-or-
    <br><br> patientFile.write(patientName + '\n')
    <br> patientFile.write(str(patientAge) + '\n')
    <br><br><b>read</b> from a file:
    <br><br>hobbyName = hobbyFile.readline() # grab hobby from the file
    <br>hobbyName = hobbyName.rstrip('\n') # strips off \n
    <br>hobbyYears = hobbyFile.readline() # grab years from file
    <br>hobbyYears = int(hobbyYears.rstrip('\n')) # strip off \n & make integer
    <h3>Using Loops to Process Files ex:</h3>
    <code><pre>
    hobbyFile = open(r'c:\Files\myhobbies.txt', 'r')
    hobbyName = hobbyFile.readline()     # priming read
    while hobbyName != '':             # empty string means End of File (EOF)
        hobbyName = hobbyName.rstrip('\n')
        hobbyYears = hobbyFile.readline()
        hobbyYears = int(hobbyYears.rstrip('\n'))
        print(hobbyName, hobbyYears)
        hobbyName = hobbyFile.readline()   #last line of the loop is another read - when the file is done the loop will get an empty string and will move to close
    hobbyFile.close()
</pre>
    </code>

    <h4>using 'for loop' to read contents</h4>
    <pre>
        hobbyFile = open(r'c:\Files\myhobbies.txt', 'r')
        for hobbyLine in hobbyFile:
            print(hobbyLine)
        hobbyFile.close()
        </pre> the above code handles all lines generically; to use them as different fields you need additional code
    <br><br> recommended reading: section 6.3 processing records to add, delete, modify records

    <br>Handling Exceptions - if you get an error from input; if you can't find a file that you are searching for; dividing a number by 0

    <pre>
    try:
        # potential risky operation
    except:
        # what to do to handle problems that might arise
    else:
        # do this only if no exception is caught
    finally:  
        # do this regardless of any exceptions
