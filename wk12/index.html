    <br><br>we start working with Classes
    <br>Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming; Classes; Working with Instances; and Techniques for Designing Classes
    <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
    Writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks
    <br>procedures typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedure
    <br>data items are commonly passed from one procedure to the another
    <br><b>Focus:</b> - to create procedures that operate on the program's data
    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    Focused on creating objects -- an <b>Object</b> is an entity that contains data and procedures
    <br><b>Data</b> is known as 'Data Attributes' and <b>Procedures</b> are known as 'Methods'
    <br><br><b>Encapsulation</b> is combining data and code into a single object
    <br>a List is an object - it will contain a sequence of data - but if we create a List named L and <b>dir(L)</b> - we will see the methods available to use on the object 'L' (List)
    <br><br>ex: <i>insect_class.py</i>
    <h4>Data Hiding</h4> (Getters and Setters)- object's data attributes are hidden from code outside the object.
    <br> this keeps Access restricted to the object's methods, which protects from accidental corruption. (Outside code does not need to know internal structure of the object)
    <br><br><b>Object Reusability</b> - same object can be used in multiple programs.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Data Attributes</b> - define the state of an object; ex: clock object will have <i>second, minute, hour</i> data attributes</li>
        <li><b>Public Methods</b> - allow external code to manipulate the object; ex: <i>set_time, set_alarm_time</i> </li>
        <li><b>Private Methods</b> - used for objects inner workings; ex: <i>circuit board, battery, wiring</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Class</b> - code that specifies the data attributes and methods of a a particular type of object. ex: <i>blueprint of a house, cookie cutter</i></li>
        <li><b>Instance</b> - object created from a class; ex: <i>houses built from the blueprint, or cookies made with that cutter.</i> There may be many instances of one class</li>
    </ul>
    the Class is an abstraction and the Instance is a specific object that can be acted upon the <b>Class Definitions</b> are a set of statements that define a class' methods and data attributes
    <br><br>Format: begin with <b><i>class Class_name:</i></b> -- class names often start with an Uppercase letter
    <br>Method definition like any other python function definition
    <br><b><i>self</i></b> parameter: required in every method in the class.
    <br><b><i>self</i></b> references the specific object that the method is working on; some programmers use 'x' instead of 'self'
    <br><br><b>Initializer Method</b> automatically executed when an instance of the class is created
    <br><b><i>def __init__(self):</i></b> - Initializes object's data attribures and assigns 'self' parameter to the object that was just created; it is Usually the first method in a class definition
    <br>all private methods have the double underscore "__"
    <br><br> To create a new instance of a class call the initializer method - My_instance = Class_Name()
    <br><br>To call any of the class methods using the created instance, use 'dot notation'
    <br><b><i>My_instance.method()</i></b>; because the 'self' parameter references the specific instance of the object, the method affect this instance;
    <br> Reference to <i>'self'</i> is passed automatically
