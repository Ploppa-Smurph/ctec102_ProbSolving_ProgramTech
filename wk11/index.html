    <b>Dictionaries</b> are objects that store collections of data
    <br> mapping key - value pairs. the key is immutable in a dictionary
    <br><br> Format to create a dictionary: <b><i>dictionary = {key1:val1, key2:val2}</i></b>
    <br><br> Elements in the dictionary are unsorted. the general format to retrieve a value from the dictionary is:
    <br> <b><i>dictionary[key]</i></b> - if 'key' is in the dictionary it is returned, otherwise we return a <i>KeyError</i> exception
    <br>we test if a key is in a dictionary with the <i>in</i> and <i>not in</i> operators.
    <h3>Adding Elements to a dictionary</h3>
    ex: <b><i>dictionary[key] = value</i></b> - if key exists in the dictionary the value associated with it will be changed

    <br><br> called an <b>Associative Array</b> or <b>Map</b> in other languages, Python refers to Key:Value pairs as a Dictionary
    <br> <i>friendface.py</i>
    <br> if you use <b><i>type()</i></b> ex: <b>type(post)</b> from the example - it will show that post is a 'dict' class
    <br><br> <b>dict</b> constructor -- format: <b>post2 = dict(message="finger food", language="en")</b>
    <br> if you try to access data with a nonexistent key then you get a <b><i>KeyError</i></b>
    <br> use the <b><i>in</i></b> operator to error handle with and if: else: ex:
    <br><b><i>>if 'location' in post2:</i></b> -- see ex: friendface.py
    <pre>
        # checking for KeyError and creating exception
        try:
            print(post2['location'])
        except KeyError: 
            print('No location found')   
        
        # see what methods the post2 dictionary has
        dir(post2)   
        
        # the .get method Returns a value for a key if it is in the dictionary, else it return <i>NONE</i> a default value
        # we set the post2.get() method to a variable named 'loc'
        loc = post2.get('location', None)
        print(loc)
        
        # .keys method - loop through the keys in a dictionary
        for key in post.keys():
            value = post[key]
            print(key, '=', value)
</pre>
    <b><i>.pop(), .popitem(), and .clear() </i></b> methods are ways to remove information from a dictionary

    <h2>Sets and Pickle</h2>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC-LUopjXSQ&list=PLLqJ8uvo5LV_dpRT-hhkGRLw5Wpk0mYM8&index=5">link to video on Sets, Serializing Objects, and Saving with Pickle</a> Set - objet that stores a collection of data in same way as mathematical set
    <br> All items must be unique, Set is Unordered, Elements can be of different data types
    <br><br><b>set()</b> the set() function is how we create and call an empty set
    <br>a non-empty set is called by: <b>set(arguement)</b> the <i>argument</i> can be a list, string, or tuple
    <br>if <i>arguement</i> is a string then each character becomes an element of the set
    <br> if the <i>argument</i> contains duplicate elements, then only 1 of the elements will appear in the set
    <br><br> there are functions that act on the set: len(), add(), and update()
    <ul>
        <li><b>len()</b> - returns the number of elements in the set</li>
        <li><b>add()</b> - adds an element to a set</li>
        <li><b>update()</b> - adds a group of elements to a set</li>
        <li><b>remove()</b> - rasises KeyError exception if item is not in the list</li>
        <li><b>discard()</b> - does not raise an exception</li>
        <li><b>clear()</b> - clears all the elements of the set</li>
    </ul>
    there is a difference between 'remove()' and 'discard()'; <i>remove()</i> will pass a KeyError exception if the item is not in the set

        # working with sets some more

        A={1,2,3}
        B={2,3,4}
        print('what is the union() of A and B?')
        print('A.union(B)')

        print('{3}<=A ', {3}<=A, ' this is True because 3 is contained in A')

    <h3>Serializing Objects</h3>
    <b>Serializing Objects</b> converts the object into a stream of bytes that can easily be stored in a file
    <br>in Python that is called <b>Pickling</b> as in 'preserving'
    <br>import <i>pickle</i> and then use the <b>pickle.dump()</b>
    <br><br><b>pickle.dump(object, file)</b>
    <ul>
        <li>import <i>pickle</i></li>
        <li>Open a file for binary writing</li>
        <li>Call the <i>pickle.dump(object, file)</i></li>
        <li>Close the file</li>
        <li>** You can pickle multiple objects to one file before closing the file</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Unpickling:</b> is the process of loading, or retrieving an object
    <br>to unpickle:
    <ul>
        <li>import <i>pickle</i> module</li>
        <li>Open a file for binary writing</li>
        <li>Call <i>pickle.load(file)</i> function</li>
        <li>close the file</li>
        <li>** You can unpickle multiple objects from the file</li>
    </ul>
    <i>ex: phoneBook.py</i>

    <h2>Introduction to Dictionaries: from Pearson Publishing</h2>
    <a href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/_video.true/Introduction_to_Dictionaries">link to the video</a> intro to Dictionaries -- an object that stores items of data
    <br> Dictionaries are different from lists because all items are stored as key:value pairs;
    <br> he uses a phonebook dictionary as the example, also. similar to what Prof Chaynikov did in his video
    <br>Lists are a sequence of items that is indexed; dictionaries are unordered
    <br>to get a value from the dictionary: <b><i>phonebook['vlad']</i></b> will return the value associated with the Key 'vlad'
    <br> if a Key does not exist then we get a KeyError exception.
    <br><b>number = phonebook['chris']</b> -- assign that to a variable then you just call number any time you need chris' number
    <br><br>using the <b><i>in</i></b> operator for exception handling
    <pre>
        if 'chris' in phonebook:
            print(phonebook['chris'])
        else:
            print('That name is not in the phonebook')
    </pre> there is also a <b><i>not in</i></b> operator which is used the same way
    <br><br> Adding new items:
    <br><b>phonebook['jimmy'] = '555-1111'</b> will create a new item in the phonebook{} dictionary.
    <br><br> Delete item from Dictionary
    <br><b>del phonebook['jimmy']</b> will delete the key:value pair from the dictionary (using the key)

    <a href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/_video.true/Introduction_to_Sets">link to the video</a>
    <br>a set is also an object that store items of data, it is different than tuples,dictionaries, and lists, because <b>All items/elements in a set must be different</b>
    <br>Sets, like dictionaries, are unordered. - the elements can be of different data types
    <br> ex: <i>setbb01.py</i>
    <pre>
    # add a list to a set
myset = set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
print(myset)
print('it breaks the letters down into individual characters and stores them unordered. When you print them out you get alphabet soup!')

# in order to pass a list of strings you have you put the list in brackets
myset = set(['john', 'paul', 'george', 'ringo'])
print(myset)

# using the .add() method
myset.add('Eric') # add Eric to the set without using brackets
print(myset)

# .remove() method
myset.remove('Eric') # remove Eric from the set -- Will throw an Exception if the item does not exist 
print(myset)

# .discard() method
myset.discard('Phillip') # discards Phillip from the set if it is there -- Will NOT throw an Exception if the item was not there

'''
There are additional methods that you can use on sets --  
        .update() - which allows you to update items in a set, merge sets, and merge lists and sets
        .cleare() - clears ALL the items in a set               
        '''
# for loop to iterate over items in a set
# using 'in' and 'not in' operators

'''UNION, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE, SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE, SUBSET, and SUPERSET'''

#Union
print('do you know what the Union of 2 sets is? it is a set that contains ALL of the elements of BOTH sets.')
set02 = set(['paul', 'lance', 'hank', 'johnny'])
print('this is myset:', myset)
print('this is set02:', set02)
set3 = myset.union(set02)
print('this is the union of myset and set02:', set3)

# Intersection
print('have you heard of an intersection? it is a set that contains ')
intersection = myset.intersection(set02)
print('this is the intersection of myset and set02: ',intersection)
intersection02 = set02.intersection(myset)
print('this is the intersection of set02 and myset: ',intersection02)

#Difference
print('what is the difference between 2 sets, you can use the "-" operator? a set that contains the elements that are Different from the 1st set to the second set.')
difference = myset.difference(set02)
print('this is the difference of myset - set02: ',difference)
difference02 = set02.difference(myset)
print('this is the difference of set02 - myset: ',difference02)
print('the order makes a difference this time')

#SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE
print('now i know you are wondering about symmetric difference, you can use the "^" operator, it is a set that contains the elements from both sets that are NOT in both sets already.')
sym = myset.symmetric_difference(set02)
print('this the symmetric difference of myset ^ set02: ', sym)

# kept getting Attribute errors with Subset and Superset
'''#SUBSET and SUPERSET
print('to find the Subset of 2 sets, you can use the "<=" operator. a subset is ')
set03 = ('123456')
set04 = ('1234')
print('working with 2 different sets now, set03 and set04', set03, set04)
print('we can see that set04 is a subset of set03: ', set04.<=(set03))
print('and that set03 is the superset of set04: ', set03.>=(set04))'''
