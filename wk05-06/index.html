    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSP5rzkMlk&list=PLLqJ8uvo5LV8odkS_t0dp3ZCPYxw6R5r1">link to video part 1</a> Void Functions and Value Returning Functions
    <br><br>Random and Math package (module)
    <br> storing functions in modules
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    functions are a group of statements within a program that perform tasks -- the 'Divide and Conquer' approach because each function can be executed in order to perform overall tasks
    <br><br>functions help create more readable code that is easier to debug
    <br><br>Functions help to make more simple code, they allow for code to be reused (since you can call on a function)
    <br>functions cannot be named the same as keywords, cannot contain spaces, first character must be a letter or underscore, all other characters must be letter, number of underscore, upper and lower case are distinct
    <br>function names should be descriptive of the task they perform, often include verbs.
    <h4>Void Function</h4> executes the statements contained and then terminates

    <br>print is an example of a 'void function' - it prints it's output and terminates

    <h4>Value-Returning Function</h4> executes the statement and returns value - 'input', 'int', 'float' will all be value-returning
    <h3>def function_name():</h3>
    to create a function you 'define' it with 'def' - functions have parens () and end with ':'
    <br> when you execute a function you 'call' it - the program will jump back to that function and then returns to the point in the program it was before (the 'function return')
    <br><br>INDENTATION - each block in a function must be indented - blank lines are ignored
    <br><br> in flowcharts the function call is shown as a rectangle with vertical bars at each side
    <br> there is typically a separate flow chart for each function in a program - the 'END' terminal symbol will read 'Return'
    <br><br> the 'Top-down design' technique is used to break algorithms into functions
    <h3>Local Variables</h3> local variables are defined and called inside a function -- cannot be called from outside the function
    <br> local variables cannot be accessed by statements inside the function preceding it's creation
    <br>local variables can share the same name in different functions, because they will not see each other if they are in separate functions
    <h3>Passing Arguments to Functions</h3>
    arguments are data sent into a function. when calling the function the argument is placed in parentheses following the function name
    <pre>
def main():
    value = 5
    show_double(value)

    def show_double(number):
        result = number * 2
        print(result)
    </pre>
    <h4>Parameter</h4> is a variable assigned value of argument when the function is called - parameters are listed at the top in parentheses, where the function is defined.
    <br><br>python allows multiple arguments to be passed into a function a 'parameter list' is comma separated
    <h4>examples in IDLE </h4>
    ex: king.py, change.py, turtle03.py -- all of these are examples of void functions

    <br><br>ex: polite.py asks for a user name and title and creates a polite greeting with the inputted values
    <br> we create a program that calls upon parameters in a value-return function

    <h1>Bill Barry's Python Intro to Functions</h1>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk5qqp7DSlU&list=PLrCtLWOL70NSmuUs4D0jzOJr3yQ1jSRBw&index=15">Gentle intro to Functions part01 video</a>
    <br> Lazy Professor example - func1 gets snacks, func2 gets markers and erasers, func3 writes information to billboard.
    <br> func1 needs input and gets output, func2 does not need input and gives output, func3 needs input but is a void because she prints and is done
    <br><br> Call Hierarchy - professor (main program) has functions for: get snacks, get markers, write on board. the get snacks function has 3 subs: get fritos, get pepsi, get mints
    <br> Call Stack - - each part of the program has an order that calls the function
    <br><br>Bill keeps mentioning the 'contract' of functions, and how functions fulfill 'contracts' <pre>
    define GetSnacks(in: order and money; out: snacks, change):
        go to third floor for 
        go to second floor for 
        go to 1st floor for
        return snacks change
    def GetMarker(in: nothing; out: markers, eraser):
        go to office and retrieve marker and eraser
        return
    def WriteOnBoard(in:date, lesson; out: nothing):
        print(date, lesson)
</pre> <br> in the above pseudocode the 'in' items are the parameters and the 'outs' are 'return' values
    <br><br> more pseudocode:
    <pre>
    def main():
        snackMoney = 7.00
        lessonTitle = 'Intro to Chem'
        snacks, change = \ getSnacks(snackMoney)
        markers, eraser = getMarkers()
        writeOnBoard(lessonTitle)
    main()

 functions would be:

    def getSnacks(money):
        #go to third floor...
        return snacks, change

    def getMarkers():
        #go to the office
        return markers, eraser

    def writeOnBoard(lessonTitle):
        #walk to white board and print information [NO Return - VOID]
    </pre>
    <h3>BB's Functions part 02</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXRC51TTsFw&list=PLrCtLWOL70NSmuUs4D0jzOJr3yQ1jSRBw&index=16">link to Functions part 02</a>
    <br><br>functions are blocks of code that help to simplify long programs. functions facilitate teamwork and help with 'top-down' design
    <h4>Designing Programs to Use Functions</h4> using a 'Top-Down' or Hierarchy Chart
    <br><br> payroll ex: start at top with 'Payroll'
    <br>then: 'get emp data'; 'calc payroll'; 'print checks', 'print report'
    <br>under 'get emp data' we need to 'get emp hours' & 'get emp wage'; and under 'calc payroll' we would have: 'Gross pay', 'Withholding'; 'Social Security'; 'Net Pay'
    <br><br> the above example is 'Functional Decomposition', aka Top-Down Design which results in a Hierarchy Chart (looks like a flowchart when drawn out) of functions for our program
    <h4>Defining Functions</h4>
    you define a function by typing 'def' at the beginning of the line, name the function, it must have parenthesis and end with a colon: -- the colon let's python know the following code is blocked with this statement
    <br>def sayHello():
    <br>.....print('hello') ## tabbed over
    <br>sayHello() -- call the function

    <br><br> ex: sayHello.py
    <h4>Parameters and Return Values</h4>
    a function's input is a 'parameter' == ex: dogYears.py
    <h3>Built-in Modules</h3>
    import random; import math ex: mathex01.py
    <br><br> to make a custom module you put the functions in a separate .py file and 'import' your .py filename
    <h2>BB Chap 05 Project: Bakery Order</h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj5wzfSO_rs&list=PLrCtLWOL70NSmuUs4D0jzOJr3yQ1jSRBw&index=17">link to bakery project part 01</a> ex: /bakery/bakery.py
    <pre>
# customer enters # of pies they wish to order and the order is formatted for display
# calculate order based on quantity totals for pie or cake; price per pie ($17.99) and price per cake ($24.99)
# calculates tax of 9.5% - display order summary with totals and tax

# call Hierarchy== Main -> will call: Input order Data; Price order, Display summary.
# Price order will call: -> Price pie; Price Cakes; Calculate Tax; Calculate Total

# - annotate the Hierarchy and find out what DATA each Function needs to complete it's job
# our input order data will not need any data from Main, but it is important that it 'Returns' it's inputted data back to Main so the program can work properly
# Price order needs the cake and pie count from Main, then Price Order will pass that information on for pricing
# price pies receives # of pies from Price Order and 'returns' the total pie price 
# price cakes receives the # of cakes from Price Order and returns the total cake price
# Calculate Tax then receives the current price order (including the current pie and cake count) and calculates tax based on that information - the tax is returned to price order
# Calculate Total receives the price total of pies, price total of cakes, and tax total and calculates the total order and returns the total to Price Order
# Price Order Returns information to Main
# Main calls Display Summary and delivers the pie quantity and price, the cake quantity and price, the tax, and the order total to display as a void function - it outputs and returns nothing.

    <br>-- fleshed out some of the programs parameters and returns in the first part (using the Hiearchy Chart)

    <br><br> **** Define Constants at the top with caps and underscore, ex: <b>CONSTANT_NAME</b> that way they will stick out in the program where they are called upon
