    <br><br> binary, you'll need to be comfortable with it for programming and data storage
    <br>8 bits (1 byte) - is 0-255, so 256 characters
    <br><br> the computer calculator has a 'Programmer' function and it will tell you the decimal value
    <h3>syntax and keywords</h3>
    in programming you can have syntax and logic errors.
    <br><br>some python <b>keywords:</b> if; and; while; True; not
    <h3>Compilers and Interpreters</h3>
    <b><i>Compilers</i></b> - take all the code and compile into an executable file which runs on the system. - with compilers you don't have to share your source code, so it is more protected. you simply share the executable. <br>syntax errors only are
    exposed when you compile, cannot successfully compile until any syntax error is fixed.
    <br><br><b><i>Interpreters</i></b> - take code from a source, convert the code to binary, and execute the resulting code. with interpreters, syntax errors are revealed when the code is interpreted and will only run when corrected.
